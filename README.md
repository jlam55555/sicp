Work related to the book *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* for ECE491.

### Environment
I used [Chez Scheme 9.4][cs9.4] in Emacs with the `geiser-chez` and `paredit` plugins from the MELPA repository. (The latest release of Chez Scheme (9.5.4) was buggy with geiser.)

### Resources
- [The online version of *SICP*][sicp] (includes the full text, sample assignments, errata, full code, etc.)
